BASICS
1. JSX stands for Javascript in XML
2. We can write all the HTML inside the Javascript file
3. class --> className
4. <code> </code>
5. {} --> javascript expression
    Eg: <p>{[1,2,3]}</p> result is 123
6. Objects are not valid as React child
7. Boolean will not render to the page as well
8. Only Arrays will work 
9 Commenting out some code:  . 
    {
    /* <p>{name}</p> */
    }
10. After installing es7 snippets, cmd + shift + R

FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS
1. you create and component in such as Header.js and import it into the parent component App.js. 

CLICK EVENTS: 
Inside the main function: 
const anonymousFunction = () => {
    const handleClick1 = () => {
      console.log('button click');
    }
  
    const handleClick2 = (e) => {
      console.log('button click', e);
    }
    
    return (
      <main>
      <header>Hi {nameHandler()}</header>
      <button onClick={handleClick1}>click1</button>  --> Called immediately as we are not using paranthesis
      <button onClick={() => handleClick2('Teja')}>click2</button> --> Called only on click
      </main>
    )
}
