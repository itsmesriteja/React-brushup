// React in my Words

INITIAL SETUP
1. Install node.js and check its version
2. create a react app in the specific folder by using the command npx create-react-app 01tut(project name)
3. Install extensions such as es7 react snippets and set the emmet suggestions int he settings file.

BASICS
1. JSX stands for Javascript in XML
2. We can write all the HTML inside the Javascript file
3. class --> className
4. <code> </code>
5. {} --> javascript expression
    Eg: <p>{[1,2,3]}</p> result is 123
6. Objects are not valid as React child
7. Boolean will not render to the page as well
8. Only Arrays will work 
9 Commenting out some code:  . 
    {
    /* <p>{name}</p> */
    }
10. After installing es7 snippets, cmd + shift + R

FUNCTIONAL COMPONENTS
1. you create and component in such as Header.js and import it into the parent component App.js. 

CLICK EVENTS: 
Inside the main function: 
const anonymousFunction = () => {
    const handleClick1 = () => {
      console.log('button click');
    }
  
    const handleClick2 = (e) => {
      console.log('button click', e);
    }
    Go to header.js comppnents.

USE STATE HOOK: 

1. With the help of useState hook we can destructure the the property and set some default value to it. 
2. We can also think of the destructered properties as getter and setter
3. eg: name, setName
4. The setName property is used to set the new value
5. Imp: When ever we acces the default property i.e 'name', It wont be immediately changed. SEE THROUGH
